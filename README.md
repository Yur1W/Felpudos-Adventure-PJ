## Overview
This project aims to demonstrate my capabilities in creating a complete 2D game in Unity, using a predefined set of assets provided by the professor. It is the final practical exam for the **Programação de Jogos** course and is used to assess our understanding and application of concepts studied in class, such as 2D game structure, visual presentation, narrative, and game design. This project becomes an important milestone in our development as game designers and programmers.

## Game Script
Felpudo was living a peaceful moment in the jungle alongside his girlfriend Fofura, until that peace is shattered when the villain Iruca appears and kidnaps her. Without hesitation, Felpudo decides to begin a rescue journey, following the enemy’s tracks until he finds a secret base. There, he infiltrates corridors full of henchmen, manages to capture one of Iruca’s underlings, and steals a plane to continue the chase.

With the stolen plane, Felpudo flies straight to Iruca’s Empire, a territory completely controlled by the villain. When he arrives, he finds a car and turns to a high-speed chase through the empire’s lands. After facing Iruca in a final showdown, Felpudo defeats him and frees Fofura, reuniting the couple and thwarting, the villan’s plans.

## Game Design
The Game consists of 3 main gameplay stiles, Felpudo`s Love (Plataformer), Felpudo`s Flight (Bullet Hell), Felpudo`s Race (Infinity Runner), with each one representeing a milestone in felpudo`s adventure to rescue his girlfriend.

## What is the Exam about?
The exam consists of building a 2D game in Unity using only the assets made available by the professor as the base for environments, characters and interface elements. After development, the project must be presented in a seminar, where the final product will be evaluated according to the following:

### Visual Presentation (10%)
- Using the provided assets in a coherent and visually pleasing way.
- Ensuring that menus, HUD and feedback elements are visible and consistent.

### Art / Design (10%)
- Choosing colors, composition and framing that reinforce the game’s mood.
- Respecting the style of the original assets while adapting them to the game’s proposal.

### Narrative / Script (40%)
- Defining the game’s world, characters, conflict and objectives.
- Establishing beginning, development and conclusion for the experience (or a strong episodic cut).

### Game Design (30%)
- Designing the core gameplay loop, rules and player actions.
- Defining controls, difficulty curve, rewards and punishments.

### Levels (10%)
- Creating interesting layouts that explore the mechanics and assets.
- Ensuring that each stage contributes to the overall progression of the game.
